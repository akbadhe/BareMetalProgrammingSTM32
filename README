*Bare Metal Programming for STM32 Blinking of LED*

*Description:
 In this project I am using STM32F103CxT6 (x=8/6) board for programming in a bare metal approach without using any IDE.
 It comprises of 
   1. Writing linker_script.ld for linking the object files and placing the code and data at appropriate places in memory(flash and RAM).
   2. Writing startup_code.c which will be the first code executed by the CPU at start of the Flash memory(0x08000000).
   3. Writing main() function which will be called from the startup code.
   4. Writing MakeFile which will cross compile the code with arm gcc toolchain.

*Build 
    make

*Flashing code using OpenOCD 
    openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32f1x.cfg -c "program final.bin verify reset exit 0x08000000"
